### Tech stack 

I primarily work on **Ruby + Rails + MySQL** at work, with **GraphQL** acting as the API for the React frontent.

For hobby projects, these  are the technologies I reach for:

- **Ruby + Rails + SQLite** as the default stack for hobby web apps like [photography](https://photos.nithinbekal.com/) and [bookmarks](https://bukmark.me/) sites
  - **Postgres** was my default DB in the past, but I like having the simplicity of SQLite
- **Elixir + Phoenix + SQLite** when I'm looking for a change of scenery from Rails ([Devlibrary](https://devlibrary.org/))
- **Fly.io** for hosting web apps
- **Cloudflare** for domains and CDN 

**Blogging**

- **Jekyll** with [custom theme](https://github.com/nithinbekal/nithinbekal.github.io/)
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **S3** for hosting images and assets
- **Cloudflare** CDN 
- **Obsidian** for editing markdown
